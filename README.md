## About Beacon

Beacon is a small web API built on [Lumen](https://lumen.laravel.com/) that helps keep track of self-hosted instances of [AvaIre](https://github.com/avaire/avaire).

Beacon tracks the following things:

 * The bot name
 * The bot ID
 * The bot versions
 * The bots avatar hash ID
 * Shards along with how many users, channels, and servers it is on

> Beacon will **not** store any user, channel, or guild IDs the bot is on.
